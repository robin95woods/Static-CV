            <p>
                Introduction to Algorithms Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with Charles Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein.
                For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about the secret to writing a best-selling textbook. Here are answers to 
                a few frequently asked questions about Introduction to Algorithms: Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available? We
                are currently working on the fourth edition. No public release date has been set. If you're wondering whether to hold off buying the third
                edition in anticipation of the fourth edition, I advise you not to wait. Where is the website for the book? The MIT Press site is 
                http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms. Where can I find a list of errata? We maintain an errata page that allows you to list errors
                by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to list only the errors
                posted since the last date that you asked about. How do I report errors? First, please visit the errata page to verify that the error
                has not been reported already. Once you have determined that you have found an unreported error, send email to clrs-bugs@mit.edu. We 
                will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day. Do you correct errors? Yes. Each time a new printing is produced, it contains 
                corrections to all errors that have been reported by that time. The errata page indicates in which printing each error was corrected.
                Because we are intensively working on the fourth edition, I am no longer posting errors in the third edition. <em>What is the difference 
                between an edition and a printing?</em> Each edition is a major revision of the book. The first edition of Introduction to Algorithms
                was published in 1990, the second edition came out in 2001, and the third edition appeared in 2009. A printing for a given edition
                occurs when the publisher needs to manufacture more copies. As the answer to the previous question indicates, we have been correcting
                errors in each printing of the second and third editions. We perturb the pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for
                a new printing. Can I get solutions to exercises and problems? As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for a select
                set of exercises and problems. They are posted at the MIT Press website. We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is 
                available only to instructors who have adopted the book for course use. The manual has lecture notes and solutions to additional 
                exercises and problems, but by no means all of them. (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and problems would take 
                somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.) You'll need to contact the MIT Press for passwords to access the manual site and the files. 
                (Contact information is at the MIT Press website.) You cannot get the passwords from me or from any of my coauthors. <strong>I will not respond
                to requests for the manual or for solutions.</strong>
